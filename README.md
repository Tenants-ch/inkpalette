# Inkpalette

Its a simple game about collecting Ink. If you collected enough Ink of one Color you can unlock the next color.

The Goal is to collect all the Colors and to Upgrade them to the max level. 

If you want to enhance the Color collecting, you can go a level deeper and upgrade all the inner workings of each Color.

If you also want to Upgrade the second level, you can even go one level deeper.

You can have a look at the Statistics of your gameplay.
We record which Button you have used and how many time you collected the Color.

There is also a Settingspage where you can reset your progress and start the game new.

There might also be some hidden stats we did not talk about.. Maybe you will be able to find them.
